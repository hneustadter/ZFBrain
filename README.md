This code is used to visualize the Zebra Finch brain in 3D.

## Usage

## Development / Contributing

Make sure you are in the top-level directory ("ZFBrain"). 

To run the main program, type (`$` refers to command line prompt)

`$ python zfbrain`

To run all unit tests, type

`$ python -m unittest -v`

(the `-v` option stands for "verbose" and lists each test that is run)

We will eventually probably use sphynx for documentation.
