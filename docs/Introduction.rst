The neural pathways of the zebra finch that are involved in the production of song have proven to have many parallels with the inner workings of the human brain used in the production of speech. Zebra finches and humans both (1) have evolved to possess similar vocal tracts in the brain that allow for hearing and the rapid production of vocal sounds; (2) possess a specific forebrain network used for auditory processing and motor sequencing of learned vocal sounds; and (3) develop their adult speech patterns during specific time periods for both auditory and sensorimotor learning. Three of the primary structures involved in this research include the HVC, Area X of the avian basal ganglia, and the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA). The HVC is a premotor region that consists of interneurons and connections to the association cortex, Area X, and the RA. The HVC is believed to direct different aspects of song production in adult male zebra finches and aid in auditory memory formation in adult female zebra finches. Area X is a region of the basal ganglia in the brain of a zebra finch that coordinates with the HVC to influence juvenile learning of song, particularly in the processes of vocal variation, exploration, and feedback-based evaluation. The RA consists of the vocal motor cortex and coordinates with the HVC to function largely in the recitation of bird song, specifically in relation to regulating the timing and serial order of song syllables.
