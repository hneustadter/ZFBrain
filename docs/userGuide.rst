Introduction
------------

ZFBrain displays an interactive visualization of the Zebra Finch brain in 3D.
The software presents the brain regions important for vocalization, including
the HVC, RA, and Area X. It is intended to be used as an aid for researchers
studying these brain regions.

Installation
------------

To install ZFBrain, see the releases tab on our Github, or follow 
`this link <https://github.com/hneustadter/ZFBrain/releases/latest>`_. ZFBrain is
available on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

Scientific Background
---------------------

The neural pathways of the zebra finch that are involved in the production
of song have proven to have many parallels with the inner workings of the
human brain used in the production of speech. Zebra finches and humans both
(1) have evolved to possess similar vocal tracts in the brain that allow for
hearing and the rapid production of vocal sounds; (2) possess a specific
forebrain network used for auditory processing and motor sequencing of learned
vocal sounds; and (3) develop their adult speech patterns during specific time
periods for both auditory and sensorimotor learning. Three of the primary
structures involved in this research include the HVC, Area X of the avian basal
ganglia, and the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA). The HVC is a premotor
region that consists of interneurons and connections to the association cortex,
Area X, and the RA. The HVC is believed to direct different aspects of song
production in adult male zebra finches and aid in auditory memory formation in
adult female zebra finches. Area X is a region of the basal ganglia in the brain
of a zebra finch that coordinates with the HVC to influence juvenile learning of
song, particularly in the processes of vocal variation, exploration, and feedback-
based evaluation. The RA consists of the vocal motor cortex and coordinates with
the HVC to function largely in the recitation of bird song, specifically in relation
to regulating the timing and serial order of song syllables. [Bertram2020]_
